In this example, the ticket's priority is set to Emergency due to its potential impact on a critical business area. The SLA plan has been updated accordingly, and the ticket is assigned to a top-level technician. In some ticketing systems, customers can set their own SLA plans.

The ticket was closed after identifying the root cause as personal networking issues on the customerâ€™s end. The status was set to Resolved, and an internal note was added to inform Steve Lang that the customer was upset. It emphasized handling the situation with urgency and empathy during follow-up.
